-- [Problem 2]

accounts(_username_, email_add, website_url, open_time, sub_price, acc_type)
* url is also a candidate key

package_uses(_username_, _pack_name_, _version_)
* (username, pack_name, version) is a primary key 
* username is a foreign key to accounts.username
* (pack_name, version) is a foreign key to (package.pack_name, package.version)

packages(_pack_name_, _version_, description, pack_price)


installed_tracks(_pack_name_, _version_, _hostname_)
* (pack_name, version, hostname) is a primary key 
* (pack_name, version) is a foreign key to (package.pack_name, package.version)
* hostname is a foreign key to servers.hostname


servers(_hostname_, os_type, max_sites, server_type)

shared_server(_hostname_)
* hostname is a foreign key to server.hostname

dedi_server(_hostname_)
* hostname is a foreign key to server.hostname


basic_acc(_username_, hostname)
* username is a foreign key to account.username 
* hostname is a foreign key to shared_server.hostname 
* To enforce total participation constraint to ensure that every basic_acc has an                 associated shared_server, we use NOT NULL constraint on hostname

pref_acc(_username_, hostname)
* hostname is also a candidate key
* username is a foreign key to account.username 
* hostname is a foreign key to shared_server.hostname 
* To enforce total participation constraint to ensure that every pref_acc has an associated dedi_server, we use NOT NULL constraint on hostname
