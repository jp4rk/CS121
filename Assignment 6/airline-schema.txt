Write the relational model schema for your airline database in this file, using
the notation we have used all term.  You can indicate primary key columns by
enclosing the attribute names in _ characters.  Include descriptions of other
candidate keys or foreign keys (if any) immediately under each relation schema.
Example:

foo(_a_, b, c)
 * b is also a candidate key
 * c is a foreign key to bar.c

-- [Problem 4]

flight(_flight_num_, _flight_date_, flight_time, sour_airport, dest_airport, is_domestic, type_code)
 * type_code is a foreign key to airplane.type_code 
 * We use NOT NULL constraint on type_code to account for full participation of flight to airplane (since every flight needs one airplane)

airplane(_type_code_, company, model)
 * company, model is also a candidate key 

seat(_seat_num_, _type_code_, seat_class, seat_type, flag_exit)
 * type_code is a foreign key to airplane.type_code

ticket(_ticket_id_, ticket_price, purchase_id, customer_id)
 * purchase_id is a foreign key to purchase.purchase_id 
 * customer_id is a foreign key to traveler.customer_id 

ticket_info(_flight_num_, _flight_date_, _type_code_, _seat_num_, ticket_id)
 * ticket_id is also a candidate key
 * flight_num is a foreign key to flight.flight_num
 * flight_date is a foreign key to flight.flight_date
 * type_code is a foreign key to airplane.type_code
 * seat_num is a foreign key to seat.seat_number
 * ticket_id is a foreign key to ticket.ticket_id

purchase(_purchase_id_, purchase_date, confirm_num, customer_id)
 * confirm_num is also a candidate key 
 * customer_id is a foreign key to purchaser.customer_id
 * We use NOT NULL constraint on customer_id to account for full participation of purchase to customer (since every purchaser would be a customer)


purchaser(_customer_id_, card_num, exp_date, ver_code)
 * customer_id is a foreign key to customer.customer_id 

traveler(_customer_id_, passport_num, country, emergency_name, emergency_contact, freq_fly_num)
 * customer_id is a foreign key to customer.customer_id 

customer(_customer_id_, first_name, last_name, email) 

customer_phone(_customer_id_, _phone_num_)
 * customer_id is a foreign key to customer.customer_id 
 * Need this since we know that each customer can have multiple phone numbers.
